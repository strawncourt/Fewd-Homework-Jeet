Additional Comments:

- Nice job! The functionality is all there and your javascript is clean and error free.

- It's useful to keep your javascript properly indented (code inside function blocks or conditional blocks should be indented), this helps keep track of what code is inside a block and what isn't.

- Good use of console.log() for displaying debug info

- Good use of .trim() to clean up whitespace!

- It looks like the 'cityChange' variable might be from an earlier attempt. It's not used anywhere. Try to keep unused code to a minimum to keep your code clean and readable.
