Use media queries at a 768px breakpoint
 - Good!
As a user changes the size of a browser window:

Content remains in appropriate divs
 - Good!
Content remains visible to the user
 - Good use of hamburger menu on the landing page. The blog page doesn't have this, so there are some display problems with the menu there.
 - Your "#benfits ul" styling stays at hard coded 600px width, which causes some display problems on smaller screens. Changing this to a percent based width could solve this.
Fonts change size appropriately
 - Good use of font resize in the hero section.
Margins and padding change size appropriately
 - Good!
Content does not overlap
 - Good!
In the blog section, the two-column layout changes to a single-column layout when appropriate
 - Good!

Additional Comments:
 - Good job overall. The hamburger menu and resizing of the hero section are nice.

 - The 600px benefits section is causing some display problems. Text there could be made smaller and some of it could probably be removed entirely.
